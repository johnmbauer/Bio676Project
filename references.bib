	abstract = {Orders Oceanospirillales and Pseudomonadales play important roles in various ecosystems as the keystone taxa of microbiomes. However, the two orders present a close evolutionary relationship, which might have caused taxonomic misinterpretation and resulted in an incorrect understanding of their evolutionary history. In this study, first, we used the 16S rRNA gene sequences of 2,049 species of Gammaproteobacteria to build a phylogenetic tree, which demonstrated that reports regarding the evolutionary relationship of orders Cellvibrionales, Oceanospirillales, and Pseudomonadales based on a single conserved gene with a poor resolution have been conflicting; in particular, the major families Moraxellaceae and Pseudomonadaceae of order Pseudomonadales were separated from orders Cellvibrionales and Oceanospirillales. Subsequently, we constructed the bac120 trees of all representative reference genomes of class Gammaproteobacteria based on 120 ubiquitous single-copy proteins from bacteria and a phylogenomic tree based on the 119 core genes of 257 reference genomes obtained from orders Cellvibrionales, Oceanospirillales, and Pseudomonadales to cross validate and infer their intrinsic evolutionary relationships. These results indicated that two novel orders, Moraxellales ord. nov. and Kangiellales ord. nov., and three novel families, Marinobacteraceae fam. nov., Perlucidibacaceae fam. nov., and Zooshikellaceae fam. nov., should be proposed. Additionally, orders Cellvibrionales and Oceanospirillales were merged into the order Pseudomonadales except for families Moraxellaceae and Kangiellaceae in class Gammaproteobacteria, which currently includes 18 families. Our work sheds some light on the evolutionary history of class Gammaproteobacteria, which could facilitate the detection and taxonomic analysis of natural communities.
IMPORTANCE The orders Cellvibrionales, Oceanospirillales, and Pseudomonadales, as three major orders of the largest bacterial class, Gammaproteobacteria, play important roles in various ecosystems as the keystone taxa of microbiomes, but their evolutionary relationship is currently polyphyletic and chaotic. Here, we constructed a bac120 tree and core-genome tree and calculated the amino acid identity (AAI) value to explore their intrinsic evolutionary history. In this study, we proposed two novel orders and three novel families. This evolution study vastly reconstructed the taxonomic framework of class Gammaproteobacteria and could provide a more distinct perspective on global distribution and evolutionary patterns of these environmental microorganisms.},

	abstract = {The phylogeny of the large bacterial class Gammaproteobacteria has been difficult to resolve. Here we apply a telescoping multiprotein approach to the problem for 104 diverse gammaproteobacterial genomes, based on a set of 356 protein families for the whole class and even larger sets for each of four cohesive subregions of the tree. Although the deepest divergences were resistant to full resolution, some surprising patterns were strongly supported. A representative of the Acidithiobacillales routinely appeared among the outgroup members, suggesting that in conflict with rRNA-based phylogenies this order does not belong to Gammaproteobacteria; instead, it (and, independently, “Mariprofundus”) diverged after the establishment of the Alphaproteobacteria yet before the betaproteobacteria/gammaproteobacteria split. None of the orders Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, or Oceanospirillales were monophyletic; we obtained strong support for clades that contain some but exclude other members of all three orders. Extreme amino acid bias in the highly A+T-rich genome of Candidatus Carsonella prevented its reliable placement within Gammaproteobacteria, and high bias caused artifacts that limited the resolution of the relationships of other insect endosymbionts, which appear to have had multiple origins, although the unbiased genome of the endosymbiont Sodalis acted as an attractor for them. Instability was observed for the root of the Enterobacteriales, with nearly equal subsets of the protein families favoring one or the other of two alternative root positions; the nematode symbiont Photorhabdus was identified as a disruptor whose omission helped stabilize the Enterobacteriales root.},

	abstract = {The class Gammaproteobacteria, which forms one of the largest groups within bacteria, is currently distinguished from other bacteria solely on the basis of its branching in phylogenetic trees. No molecular or biochemical characteristic is known that is unique to the class Gammaproteobacteria or its different subgroups (orders). The relationship among different orders of gammaproteobacteria is also not clear. In this study, we present detailed phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses on gammaproteobacteria that clarify some of these issues. Phylogenetic trees based on concatenated sequences for 13 and 36 universally distributed proteins were constructed for 45 members of the class Gammaproteobacteria covering 13 of its 14 orders. In these trees, species from a number of the subgroups formed distinct clades and their relative branching order was indicated as follows (from the most recent to the earliest diverging): Enterobacteriales \&gt;Pasteurellales \&gt;Vibrionales, Aeromonadales \&gt;Alteromonadales \&gt;Oceanospirillales, Pseudomonadales \&gt;Chromatiales, Legionellales, Methylococcales, Xanthomonadales, Cardiobacteriales, Thiotrichales. Four conserved indels in four widely distributed proteins that are specific for gammaproteobacteria are also described. A 2 aa deletion in 5′-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide transformylase (AICAR transformylase; PurH) was a distinctive characteristic of all gammaproteobacteria (except Francisella tularensis). Two other conserved indels (a 4 aa deletion in RNA polymerase β-subunit and a 1 aa deletion in ribosomal protein L16) were found uniquely in various species of the orders Enterobacteriales, Pasteurellales, Vibrionales, Aeromonadales and Alteromonadales, but were not found in other gammaproteobacteria. Lastly, a 2 aa deletion in leucyl-tRNA synthetase was commonly present in the above orders of the class Gammaproteobacteria and also in some members of the order Oceanospirillales. The presence of the conserved indels in these gammaproteobacterial orders indicates that species from these orders shared a common ancestor that was separate from other bacteria, a suggestion that is supported by phylogenetic studies. Systematic blastp searches were also conducted on various open reading frames (ORFs) in the genome of Escherichia coli K-12. These analyses identified 75 proteins that were unique to most members of the class Gammaproteobacteria or were restricted to species from some of its main orders (Enterobacteriales; Enterobacteriales and Pasteurellales; Enterobacteriales, Pasteurellales, Vibrionales, Aeromonadales and Alteromonadales; and the Enterobacteriales, Pasteurellales, Vibrionales, Aeromonadales, Alteromonadales, Oceanospirillales and Pseudomonadales etc.). The genes for these proteins have evolved at various stages during the evolution of gammaproteobacteria and their species distribution pattern, in conjunction with other results presented here, provide valuable information regarding the evolutionary relationships among these bacteria.},

	abstract = {A novel Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped plant growth promoting bacterium, NEAU-SY24T, was isolated from soil in Diaoshuihu, Heilongjiang, China. The isolate grew at temperatures 10–40 °C (optimum, 30 °C), pH 5–8 (optimum, pH 6) and in the presence of up to 1 \% (w/v) NaCl, although NaCl was not required for growth. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain NEAU-SY24T belonged to the genus Trinickia and was closely related to Trinickia dabaoshanensis NRRL B-59553T (99.16 \% similarity) and Trinickia soli DSM 18235T (99.11 \%). The average nucleotide identity values between NEAU-SY24T and its most closely related species were 79.30–87.09 \%. The in silico DNA–DNA hybridization values between NEAU-SY24T and T. dabaoshanensis NRRL B-59553T and T. soli DSM 18235T were 29.30 and 24.00 \%, respectively, again indicating they belong to different taxa. The genomic DNA G+C content was 63.3 mol\%. The major cellular fatty acids were C17 : 0cyclo, C18 : 1ω7c, C16 : 0, summed feature 2 (comprising C14 : 0 3-OH and/or C16 : 1iso I) and C16 : 0 3-OH. The predominant respiratory quinone was Q-8 and the whole-cell sugars contained ribose, glucose and galactose. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, hydroxyphosphatidylethanolamine and two unidentified aminolipids. On the basis of morphological, physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic analysis, strain NEAU-SY24T was classified as a novel species in the genus Trinickia , for which the name Trinickia diaoshuihuensis sp. nov. is proposed.

	abstract = {Burkholderia sensu lato is a large and complex group, containing pathogenic, phytopathogenic, symbiotic and non-symbiotic strains from a very wide range of environmental (soil, water, plants, fungi) and clinical (animal, human) habitats. Its taxonomy has been evaluated several times through the analysis of 16S rRNA sequences, concantenated 4–7 housekeeping gene sequences, and lately by genome sequences. Currently, the division of this group into Burkholderia, Caballeronia, Paraburkholderia, and Robbsia is strongly supported by genome analysis. These new genera broadly correspond to the various habitats/lifestyles of Burkholderia s.l., e.g., all the plant beneficial and environmental (PBE) strains are included in Paraburkholderia (which also includes all the N2-fixing legume symbionts) and Caballeronia, while most of the human and animal pathogens are retained in Burkholderia sensu stricto. However, none of these genera can accommodate two important groups of species. One of these includes the closely related Paraburkholderia rhizoxinica and Paraburkholderia endofungorum, which are both symbionts of the fungal phytopathogen Rhizopus microsporus. The second group comprises the Mimosa-nodulating bacterium Paraburkholderia symbiotica, the phytopathogen Paraburkholderia caryophylli, and the soil bacteria Burkholderia dabaoshanensis and Paraburkholderia soli. In order to clarify their positions within Burkholderia sensu lato, a phylogenomic approach based on a maximum likelihood analysis of conserved genes from more than 100 Burkholderia sensu lato species was carried out. Additionally, the average nucleotide identity (ANI) and amino acid identity (AAI) were calculated. The data strongly supported the existence of two distinct and unique clades, which in fact sustain the description of two novel genera Mycetohabitans gen. nov. and Trinickia gen. nov. The newly proposed combinations are Mycetohabitans endofungorum comb. nov., Mycetohabitansrhizoxinica comb. nov., Trinickia caryophylli comb. nov., Trinickiadabaoshanensis comb. nov., Trinickia soli comb. nov., and Trinickiasymbiotica comb. nov. Given that the division between the genera that comprise Burkholderia s.l. in terms of their lifestyles is often complex, differential characteristics of the genomes of these new combinations were investigated. In addition, two important lifestyle-determining traits—diazotrophy and/or symbiotic nodulation, and pathogenesis—were analyzed in depth i.e., the phylogenetic positions of nitrogen fixation and nodulation genes in Trinickia via-à-vis other Burkholderiaceae were determined, and the possibility of pathogenesis in Mycetohabitans and Trinickia was tested by performing infection experiments on plants and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It is concluded that (1) T. symbiotica nif and nod genes fit within the wider Mimosa-nodulating Burkholderiaceae but appear in separate clades and that T. caryophyllinif genes are basal to the free-living Burkholderia s.l. strains, while with regard to pathogenesis (2) none of the Mycetohabitans and Trinickia strains tested are likely to be pathogenic, except for the known phytopathogen T. caryophylli.},

	abstract = {The anthropogenic release of atmospheric CO2 affects soil nutrient cycling through varied biogeochemical processes. Cation depletion from exchange sites, carbonate mineral dissolution, and subsequent changes in organic and inorganic carbon flux are growing concerns for soil health and sustainability. Particularly, the effects of acid deposition on soil pH and soil health under changing global carbon flux is poorly understood. To estimate the magnitude and effects of pH change across different soil profiles, the depth-wise response of soil cations, pH, and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) to varying CO2 levels was investigated using column-leachate experiments. Six soils, representing acidic, neutral, and alkaline pH, were exposed to different CO2 enrichments (100\%, 10\%, 1\%, and Control) of water percolate for 30 days. Analysis of the column leachates revealed that the base cations (Ca, Mg, Na) were higher initially than on day 30, while Si leaching increased with time. The pH in leachates tended to attain an equilibrium state with time under CO2 saturation, indicating the buffering capacity of alkaline and neutral soils. Evaluation of the soil before and after the experiments showed that the solid SIC, such as carbonate minerals and any dissolved SIC components (e.g., carbonate, bicarbonate ions) entrained in the pore space increased, whereas the potential cation exchange capacity (PCEC) decreased in all soils. This trend was especially prominent for alkaline soils at 100\% CO2 enrichment. Over the short-term study, the SIC showed minimal response to varying CO2 enrichment conditions in neutral and acidic soils. The altered cation concentrations in the leachates suggest that under long-term exposure to elevated CO2, a deficiency of cationic essential plant nutrients such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ is likely, especially with low buffering capacity and primary mineral content. In contrast, an increase in nutrient solubility and elemental toxicity (e.g., Al3+ Mn) can be observed in the short term. The initial soils with greater ECEC experienced an increased SIC leaching in the shorter term and suggested potential deposition in deeper layers. The resultant SIC loss might be amplified in arid to semi-arid soils with low SIC and affect soil health.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions drive global-scale warming yet the temperature increase relative to pre-industrial levels is uncertain. Using 300 years of ocean mixed-layer temperature records preserved in sclerosponge carbonate skeletons, we demonstrate that industrial-era warming began in the mid-1860s, more than 80 years earlier than instrumental sea surface temperature records. The Sr/Ca palaeothermometer was calibrated against ‘modern’ (post-1963) highly correlated (R2 = 0.91) instrumental records of global sea surface temperatures, with the pre-industrial defined by nearly constant ({\textless}±0.1 °C) temperatures from 1700 to the early 1860s. Increasing ocean and land-air temperatures overlap until the late twentieth century, when the land began warming at nearly twice the rate of the surface oceans. Hotter land temperatures, together with the earlier onset of industrial-era warming, indicate that global warming was already 1.7 ± 0.1 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2020. Our result is 0.5 °C higher than IPCC estimates, with 2 °C global warming projected by the late 2020s, nearly two decades earlier than expected.},

	abstract = {Irrational nitrogen (N) fertilizer management and application practices have led to a range of ecological and environmental problems that seriously threaten food security. In this study, an effective N fertilizer management strategy was established for improving N fertilizer utilization efficiency (NUE). Biochar, N2-fixing bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae), and a nitrification inhibitor (dicyandiamide, DCD) were simultaneously added to the soil during maize cultivation. The goal was to increase soil ammonium nitrogen content and NUE by regulating the relative abundance, enzyme activity, and functional gene expression of N conversion-related soil microbes. Biochar combined with E. cloacae and DCD significantly increased soil N content, and the NUE reached 46.69 \%. The relative abundance of Burkholderia and Bradyrhizobium and the activity of nitrogenase increased significantly during biological N2 fixation. Further, the abundance of the nifH gene was significantly up-regulated. The relative abundance of Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Nitrospira, and Castellaniella and the activities of ammonia monooxygenase and nitrate reductase decreased significantly during nitrification and denitrification. Moreover, the abundance of the genes amoA and narG was significantly down-regulated. Correlation analyses showed that the increase in soil N2 fixation and the suppression of nitrification and denitrification reactions were the key contributors to the increase in soil N content and NUE. Biochar combined with E. cloacae and DCD synergistically enabled the supplementation, slow release, and retention of N, thus providing adequate N for maize growth. Thus, the combination of biochar, E. cloacae, and DCD is effective for mitigating the irrational application of N fertilizers and reducing N pollution.},

	abstract = {Citrus bacterial canker (CBC) is an important disease of citrus cultivars worldwide that causes blister-like lesions on host plants and leads to more severe symptoms such as plant defoliation and premature fruit drop. The causative agent, Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, exists as three pathotypes—A, A*, and Aw—which differ in their host range and elicited host response. To date, comparative analyses have been hampered by the lack of closed genomes for the A* pathotype. In this study, we sequenced and assembled six CBC isolates of pathotype A* using second- and third-generation sequencing technologies to produce complete, closed assemblies. Analysis of these genomes and reference A, A*, and Aw sequences revealed genetic groups within the A* pathotype. Investigation of accessory genomes revealed virulence factors, including type IV secretion systems and heavy metal resistance genes, differentiating the genetic groups. Genomic comparisons of closed genome assemblies also provided plasmid distribution information for the three genetic groups of A*. The genomes presented here complement existing closed genomes of A and Aw pathotypes that are publicly available and open opportunities to investigate the evolution of X. citri pv. citri and the virulence factors that contribute to this serious pathogen.},
