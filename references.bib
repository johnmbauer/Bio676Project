	abstract = {Orders Oceanospirillales and Pseudomonadales play important roles in various ecosystems as the keystone taxa of microbiomes. However, the two orders present a close evolutionary relationship, which might have caused taxonomic misinterpretation and resulted in an incorrect understanding of their evolutionary history. In this study, first, we used the 16S rRNA gene sequences of 2,049 species of Gammaproteobacteria to build a phylogenetic tree, which demonstrated that reports regarding the evolutionary relationship of orders Cellvibrionales, Oceanospirillales, and Pseudomonadales based on a single conserved gene with a poor resolution have been conflicting; in particular, the major families Moraxellaceae and Pseudomonadaceae of order Pseudomonadales were separated from orders Cellvibrionales and Oceanospirillales. Subsequently, we constructed the bac120 trees of all representative reference genomes of class Gammaproteobacteria based on 120 ubiquitous single-copy proteins from bacteria and a phylogenomic tree based on the 119 core genes of 257 reference genomes obtained from orders Cellvibrionales, Oceanospirillales, and Pseudomonadales to cross validate and infer their intrinsic evolutionary relationships. These results indicated that two novel orders, Moraxellales ord. nov. and Kangiellales ord. nov., and three novel families, Marinobacteraceae fam. nov., Perlucidibacaceae fam. nov., and Zooshikellaceae fam. nov., should be proposed. Additionally, orders Cellvibrionales and Oceanospirillales were merged into the order Pseudomonadales except for families Moraxellaceae and Kangiellaceae in class Gammaproteobacteria, which currently includes 18 families. Our work sheds some light on the evolutionary history of class Gammaproteobacteria, which could facilitate the detection and taxonomic analysis of natural communities.
IMPORTANCE The orders Cellvibrionales, Oceanospirillales, and Pseudomonadales, as three major orders of the largest bacterial class, Gammaproteobacteria, play important roles in various ecosystems as the keystone taxa of microbiomes, but their evolutionary relationship is currently polyphyletic and chaotic. Here, we constructed a bac120 tree and core-genome tree and calculated the amino acid identity (AAI) value to explore their intrinsic evolutionary history. In this study, we proposed two novel orders and three novel families. This evolution study vastly reconstructed the taxonomic framework of class Gammaproteobacteria and could provide a more distinct perspective on global distribution and evolutionary patterns of these environmental microorganisms.},

	abstract = {The phylogeny of the large bacterial class Gammaproteobacteria has been difficult to resolve. Here we apply a telescoping multiprotein approach to the problem for 104 diverse gammaproteobacterial genomes, based on a set of 356 protein families for the whole class and even larger sets for each of four cohesive subregions of the tree. Although the deepest divergences were resistant to full resolution, some surprising patterns were strongly supported. A representative of the Acidithiobacillales routinely appeared among the outgroup members, suggesting that in conflict with rRNA-based phylogenies this order does not belong to Gammaproteobacteria; instead, it (and, independently, “Mariprofundus”) diverged after the establishment of the Alphaproteobacteria yet before the betaproteobacteria/gammaproteobacteria split. None of the orders Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, or Oceanospirillales were monophyletic; we obtained strong support for clades that contain some but exclude other members of all three orders. Extreme amino acid bias in the highly A+T-rich genome of Candidatus Carsonella prevented its reliable placement within Gammaproteobacteria, and high bias caused artifacts that limited the resolution of the relationships of other insect endosymbionts, which appear to have had multiple origins, although the unbiased genome of the endosymbiont Sodalis acted as an attractor for them. Instability was observed for the root of the Enterobacteriales, with nearly equal subsets of the protein families favoring one or the other of two alternative root positions; the nematode symbiont Photorhabdus was identified as a disruptor whose omission helped stabilize the Enterobacteriales root.},

	abstract = {The class Gammaproteobacteria, which forms one of the largest groups within bacteria, is currently distinguished from other bacteria solely on the basis of its branching in phylogenetic trees. No molecular or biochemical characteristic is known that is unique to the class Gammaproteobacteria or its different subgroups (orders). The relationship among different orders of gammaproteobacteria is also not clear. In this study, we present detailed phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses on gammaproteobacteria that clarify some of these issues. Phylogenetic trees based on concatenated sequences for 13 and 36 universally distributed proteins were constructed for 45 members of the class Gammaproteobacteria covering 13 of its 14 orders. In these trees, species from a number of the subgroups formed distinct clades and their relative branching order was indicated as follows (from the most recent to the earliest diverging): Enterobacteriales \&gt;Pasteurellales \&gt;Vibrionales, Aeromonadales \&gt;Alteromonadales \&gt;Oceanospirillales, Pseudomonadales \&gt;Chromatiales, Legionellales, Methylococcales, Xanthomonadales, Cardiobacteriales, Thiotrichales. Four conserved indels in four widely distributed proteins that are specific for gammaproteobacteria are also described. A 2 aa deletion in 5′-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide transformylase (AICAR transformylase; PurH) was a distinctive characteristic of all gammaproteobacteria (except Francisella tularensis). Two other conserved indels (a 4 aa deletion in RNA polymerase β-subunit and a 1 aa deletion in ribosomal protein L16) were found uniquely in various species of the orders Enterobacteriales, Pasteurellales, Vibrionales, Aeromonadales and Alteromonadales, but were not found in other gammaproteobacteria. Lastly, a 2 aa deletion in leucyl-tRNA synthetase was commonly present in the above orders of the class Gammaproteobacteria and also in some members of the order Oceanospirillales. The presence of the conserved indels in these gammaproteobacterial orders indicates that species from these orders shared a common ancestor that was separate from other bacteria, a suggestion that is supported by phylogenetic studies. Systematic blastp searches were also conducted on various open reading frames (ORFs) in the genome of Escherichia coli K-12. These analyses identified 75 proteins that were unique to most members of the class Gammaproteobacteria or were restricted to species from some of its main orders (Enterobacteriales; Enterobacteriales and Pasteurellales; Enterobacteriales, Pasteurellales, Vibrionales, Aeromonadales and Alteromonadales; and the Enterobacteriales, Pasteurellales, Vibrionales, Aeromonadales, Alteromonadales, Oceanospirillales and Pseudomonadales etc.). The genes for these proteins have evolved at various stages during the evolution of gammaproteobacteria and their species distribution pattern, in conjunction with other results presented here, provide valuable information regarding the evolutionary relationships among these bacteria.},
